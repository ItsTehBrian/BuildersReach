Build from afar.

This is a new, super cool (**VERY BETA DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION**) plugin!

* [Download](https://github.com/TehBrian/BuildersReach/releases/latest)

## Features
- Run `/br` to enable interacting with blocks from afar.
- `/br color <color>` sets the highlighter color.
- `/br distance <blocks>` sets how far you can reach.
- Various types of highlighters because, frankly, they all kinda suck!

Try it now! :D
